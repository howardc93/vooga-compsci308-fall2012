Use Instructions:

Open and run ParticleEngineApplet.

Press one of the following buttons to create a particle system of the
corresponding type at your last mouse click position.

Particle System hotkeys
B - bubbles
F - fire 
	Note: this effect is not working at the moment
I - fireworks
L - light 
	Note: this effect is still under construction.
S - snow
	Note: The Snow ParticleSystem spawns snow particles along the line from the left-hand side of the
	applet to the position you clicked, perpendicular to the left-hand side of the applet.
W - waterfall with mist

C - clears all ParticleSystems from the applet

Background hotkeys
1 - rocky cliff background (works well with the waterfall particle system
2 - cauldron (appropriate for the bubbles and fire particle system)

Purpose of Applet: 

This applet demonstrates the three main types of particle engine effects that our particle engine can create: explosions, fire/trail/mist,
and macro-particle effects (e.g. snow). (Actually, I just made up those 3 category names based on the kinds of particle systems we have
developed, but they seem appropriate.) The explosions and fire/trail/mist types of particle systems use large quantities of very 
fine particles to create a larger wispy, smoke-like object, whereas the macro-particle effects uses large particles which are the
end-product themselves. TO BE CONTINUED...
