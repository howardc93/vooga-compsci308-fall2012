Purpose of Applet: 

This applet demonstrates the three main types of particle engine effects that our particle engine can create: explosions, fire/trail/mist,
and macro-particle effects (e.g. snow). (Actually, I just made up those 3 category names based on the kinds of particle systems we have
developed, but they seem appropriate.) The explosions and fire/trail/mist types of particle systems use large quantities of very 
fine particles to create a larger wispy, smoke-like object, whereas the macro-particle effects uses large particles which are the
end-product themselves. 

The versatility in assignment of velocities to particles is also demonstrated in this applet. Explosion type particle systems 
contain particles with different velocity directions, while the fire/trail/mist and macro-particle effects use a single direction.

A comparison of Waterfall and Fire shows the range of complexity that can be achieved with particle system implementations. Although
both fall under the same general category of particle engine effects, Waterfall uses 6 different particle engines, whereas Fire 
only has 1.

Use Instructions:

1. Open and run ParticleEngineApplet.

2. Press one of the following buttons to create a particle system of the
corresponding type at your last mouse click position.

Particle System hotkeys
B - bubbles
F - fire
I - fireworks, ring explosion
L - light 
	Note: this effect is still under construction.
S - snow
	Note: The Snow ParticleSystem spawns snow particles along the line from the left-hand side of the
	applet to the position you clicked, perpendicular to the left-hand side of the applet.
W - waterfall with mist

C - clears all ParticleSystems from the applet

Background hotkeys
1 - rocky cliff background (works well with the waterfall particle system)
2 - cauldron (appropriate for the bubbles and fire particle system)
3 - Duke Chapel at night
