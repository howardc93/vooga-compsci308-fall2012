This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.
This package is for use by the arcade team. This package stores the 
individual components that can be loaded into AbstractPanels. 
This is basically a component utility folder. If we are using the same
component twice, we should't need to create it from scratch twice.
